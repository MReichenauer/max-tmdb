You will create an interface to The Movie Database (TMDB) where you are able to:
  * View the latest movies in theaters
  * View the most popular movies
  * View the top-rated movies in Sweden (or the USA – your choice)
  * Browse movies by genre.
  * View detailed page of a movie, including information about the movie and the actors involved. You can also click on an actor to see which movies they have appeared in.

#### Requierments
##### Technical
* Use React, React Router, React Context, and React Query.
* Responsive (mobile first).
* Component-based.

* Include loading and error handling.

##### A visitor should be able to:
* Switch between two color themes.
* See the 10-20 most recent (now playing) movies in theaters.
* See the 10-20 most popular (trending) movies.
* See the 10-20 top-rated movies.
* Browse movies (with pagination) based on genre (the genre’s title should be displayed).
* Click on a movie to get detailed information about it.
* Click on a movie to see which actors appeared in it.
* Click on a genre to see all movies in that genre.
* Click on an actor to get detailed information about the actor.
* Click on an actor to find out which movies they have appeared in.
* Click on a movie from an actor’s filmography to go to the page with detailed information about that movie.
* Switch between two color themes, e.g., light and dark (the selection should persist even after reloading the page).
